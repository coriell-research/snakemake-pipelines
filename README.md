# `snakemake` workflows developed for Coriell Bioinformatics 

## Current Workflows:

- Paired-end RNA-seq processing and quantification
- De novo transcript assembly and quantification
- Somatic variant calling from tumor-normal WES/WGS data
- Estimation of bacterial read abundance from sequencing data using Kraken2 and Braken

## Caveats

All of the workflows assume you're working on Coriell's bioinformatics servers which means
software environments and paths to pre-generated genome indeces and system resources will not
work on your machine.
